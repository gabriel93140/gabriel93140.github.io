      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This page presents my results for Project 0. The goal is to build intuition for how <em>perspective</em> depends on
        camera <strong>position</strong> (center of projection) and how changing <strong>zoom</strong>/focal length affects the field of view
        but not the underlying perspective. I captured three sets of images: (1) a selfie comparison, (2) architectural
        perspective compression, and (3) a <em>dolly zoom</em> animation.

      <h2>Part 1 — Selfie: Wrong vs Right</h2>
      <div class="grid two">
        <figure>
          <img src="images/selfie_bad.jpg" alt="Selfie shot from very close (distorted)">
          <figcaption><strong>Close-up (wrong way):</strong> shot from very near the face. The nose/forehead appear enlarged relative to the ears.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/selfie_good.jpg" alt="Selfie shot while stepping back and zooming to match face size">
          <figcaption><strong>Step back + zoom (right way):</strong> I moved back and zoomed to match face size. Proportions look more natural.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <h3>Observation</h3>
      <p>
        The difference in appearance is explained by <strong>perspective geometry</strong>. When the camera is close, distances from the
        camera to facial features vary a lot (nose ≪ ears), so perspective exaggeration makes the nose look larger. When I step
        back, those distance ratios shrink and the face looks flatter and more realistic. Importantly, <em>zooming does not change
        perspective</em>; it only narrows the field of view. The change in perspective comes solely from the <strong>camera position</strong>.

      <h2>Part 2 — Architectural Perspective Compression</h2>
      <div class="grid two">
        <figure>
          <img src="images/building_far_zoom.jpg" alt="Far position with strong zoom">
          <figcaption><strong>Far + zoom:</strong> shot from far away using strong zoom to frame the scene.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/building_close_wide.jpg" alt="Close position with wide angle">
          <figcaption><strong>Close + wide:</strong> walked forward and used a wide field of view to keep a similar subject size.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <h3>Observation</h3>
      <p>
        From the distant viewpoint, the background looks <em>compressed</em>—objects at different depths appear closer together. From the
        nearby wide-angle viewpoint, parallel lines diverge more and depth feels exaggerated. Again, this is driven by the <strong>change
        in camera position</strong>; the focal length only controls framing.

      <h2>Part 3 — Dolly Zoom ("Vertigo" Shot)</h2>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/dolly_zoom.gif" alt="Animated dolly zoom where subject size remains constant while background warps">
        <figcaption>Animated GIF assembled from still frames <code>dolly_01.jpg … dolly_10.jpg</code> by moving back and zooming in so the subject size stays constant.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Observation</h3>
      <p>
        Keeping the subject at a constant image size while changing the camera position forces the background to change scale: it
        appears to stretch or compress. This creates the classic cinematic vertigo effect and visually separates <em>framing</em> from
        <em>perspective</em>.

      <h2>Technical Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Device: smartphone camera; exposure and focus locked when possible.</li>
        <li>Framing: used on-screen grid lines to match the subject size across shots.</li>
        <li>Basic edits: mild JPEG compression for web (quality ~85), no filters.</li>
      </ul>
