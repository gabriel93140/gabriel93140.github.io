# Gabriel SAVINAUD - Computer Vision CS180
UC Berkeley - CS180 Projects

## 🎓 About Me
I am an exchange student at **UC Berkeley (Haas & EECS)** for the 2025 academic year, currently enrolled in **CS180/280A: Introduction to Computer Vision and Computational Photography**.  
My academic focus lies at the intersection of **computer vision, robotics, and applied AI**, with hands-on projects that combine image analysis, generative models, and real-world applications.

## 🚀 Current Projects
- **Tech at ACE**  
  Founder of a fast-growing media brand covering **AI, robotics, and emerging technologies**.  
  Active on TikTok, Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Facebook and YouTube, Tech at ACE aims to **simplify deep tech for a broad audience** and has already reached thousands of followers worldwide.

- **Robotics for Fast-Food Automation**  
  Exploring how **robotic arms and AI-driven systems** can automate fast-food and dark kitchen operations.  
  The vision: to design robots capable of preparing sandwiches, fries, and other meals — reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and redefining the future of quick-service restaurants.

## 🧑‍💻 Technical Interests
- **Computer Vision & AI**: ConvNets, Diffusion Models, 3D Vision, Generative Systems  
- **Robotics**: Robotic arms for food automation, quadrupeds & humanoid robots  
- **Software**: Python (OpenCV, PyTorch, scikit-image), React Native for mobile apps  
- **Entrepreneurship**: Building ventures that merge deep tech research with consumer and industrial applications

## 🌍 Goals at Berkeley
1. Build a strong foundation in computer vision and computational photography.  
2. Apply academic research to **robotics and automation in real-world settings**.  
3. Expand **Tech at ACE** as a global platform bridging academia, startups, and industry.  
4. Collaborate with fellow students and researchers on **innovative robotics and AI projects**.
